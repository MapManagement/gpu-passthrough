## SVM
SVM is the apronym for "**S**ecure **V**irtual **M**achine". In the past, most virtualization was software-based but
because of modern tasks for virtualized operating systems, a hardware-based solutions had to be invented since software-
based solutions often caused errors and crashes if they wanted to use the same resouces at the same time. Therefore AMD invented SVM (Intel also supports hardware-based virtualization, it's called [IntelÂ® VT](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html).
Because of SVM, modern AMD processors support directly virtualization. That means that your virtual machines runs much
faster than without it.
