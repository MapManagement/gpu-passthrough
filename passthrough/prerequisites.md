# Prerequisites
## Linux Distro
I decided to go with [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) for this build but it might still change if I recognize any problems or things I just do not like. So why not choosing the distro that matches best for your use case but for the beginning it will be Pop!_OS. But why, you might ask. I simply just used too Debian/Ubuntu based systems and don't want to make it unnecessary difficult for me. Furthermore did I test Linux Mint and Pop!_OS the longest time yet when it comes to desktop machines. That's really much it what I can tell you about my decision so far. 
So after installing the AMD ISO of the distro, I configured the GUI (using GNOME by the way) and some system settings. I'd say that it's time to start the actual passthrough part.
