## Finding "perfect" GPU
Most of you probably think that I'm talking about the guest GPU for my virtual machine, but I'm not. This problem is about my host GPU since my Vega 56 seems quite good for a Windows VM. So at the beginning I wanted to use a GT 710 but it only has one DVI and one HDMI port and my monitors do not support DVI. Additionally the graphics card has to handle a 3440x1440p @75Hz ultrawide display and the HDMI port of the GT 710 does not have the needed bandwidth.  
The second card I wanted to use was an older R9 290. Unfortunately that card didn't work at all. Neither Windows nor the BIOS recognized the card so I decided to buy a new one. Since I am using Linux as my host OS I bought an AMD card. To be precise, it was an RX 550 with one HDMI, DP and DVI port. That card should be enough for my purpose, especially because I won't need an extremely well performing card for Pop!_OS.
