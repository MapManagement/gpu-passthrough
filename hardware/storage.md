# Storage
Since I created this repository, I acquired some additional drives that can be used for my machine. It really is a weird mix of different SSDs and HDDs with varying capacities, read/write speeds and ages. Following structure should visualize how I plan to use them but as always, it's not a final decision and will possibly change while setting up a machine for my daily uses cases:


| Name                    | Capacity | Read     | Write     | Usage                           |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Silicon Power P34A80    |  256GB   | 3400MB/​s | 2700MB/s | Linux as Host OS                 |
| Crucial BX500           |  240GB   |  540MB/​s |  500MB/s | thinking about a Windows drive for a dual boot -> guaranty that Windows can easily be used while setting up the actual Linux machine |
| Crucial MX500           | 1000GB   |  560MB/​s |  510MB/s | Guest OSes / VMs                 |
| Intenso Premium III     |  120GB   |  550MB/​s |  470MB/​s | no idea yet -> spare SSD         |
| Toshiba P300            | 1000GB   |  7200RPM | 7200RPM  | mass storage for my Linux distro |
| Western Digital WD Blue | 3000GB   |  5400RPM | 5400RPM  | either for a home cloud/NAS or an alternative for my mass storage |
