# Games
## Rage 2
I tested [Rage 2](https://bethesda.net/en/game/rage2) in the first Windows VM that I created and had no big issues at all. At some parts of the game, I noticed some weird flickering but I don't know what caused it. Either it is bug of the
game, it was meant as a feature (the locations and scenes would have matched to thath flickering) or it is because of my
VM. Either way, I'm really happy about the result and cannot complain about the performance. More detailed test are
already planned and will be added to this sectionb aswell.

## Overwatch
Overwatch was the second game I tested. Compared to Rage 2 it's not a big deal for mid to high-end
machines at all. Getting constant 60 FPS should not be a problem for most modern pcs but since I'm
using a 144Hz monitor for all of my games, I needed to reach those 144 FPS. Everything I can say
so far is, that Overwatch runs flawlessly as well. The virtual machine has enough  power to run
the game at the constant 144 FPS I need and I couldn't recognize any other issues like weird
flickering or somehting similar. Apart from playing Overwatch most of the time when I played
somehting at that time, I chose that game because I've never heard of any probelems with its
anti-cheat software. It also runs under Linux if you're using [Proton](https://www.protondb.com/)
, therefore I had no worries about getting banned, kicked or whatever. To sum it all up, I can
only tell about good experiences with Overwatch in a virtual machine.

## Chivalry 2
Recently I started playing Chivalry 2 and I really enjoyed playing it within my Windows guest. I didn't experience any
bugsor crashes and played with almost the same FPS like on my native installation. I was also able to use my host
keyboard because of [Barrier](passthrough/extra/mouse-sharing.md#Barrier). But be aware, you can't use your host mouse
if you don't want to play with very weird mouse movements. It only happened to me when I was playing a game in fullscreen
but I'm fine with using another mouse for games as long as I'm able to use only mouse for desktop stuff.
