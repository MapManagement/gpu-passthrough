## Rage 2
I tested [Rage 2](https://bethesda.net/en/game/rage2) on the first Windows VM that I created and had no big issues at all. At some parts of the game, I noticed some weird flickering but I don't know what caused it. Either it is bug of the
game, it was meant as a feature (the locations and scenes would have matched to thath flickering) or it is because of my
VM. Either way, I'm really happy about the result and cannot complain about the performance. More detailed test are
already planned and will be added to this sectionb aswell.
