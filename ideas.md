## MacOS VM
As soon as I set up everything to create a new stable and working virtual machine for windows, it is not that hard to also create a MacOS vm. For now, I do not use any software that is only for usable within MacOS but it cannot hurt at all if I got MacOS installed too.

Some of you might already heard of that software, [LTT already made a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EozeSDeV3Vo).

It would definitely improve my workflow when I have to work with Windows and Linux at the same time.
