Welcome to my approach of setting up a machine that runs multiple operating systems simultaneously and each of it works nearly as good as if you installed and ran it on a normal system. Curious what I'm talking about? Maybe you already heard of somehting like gpu-passthrough, looking-glass or vfio. At the end it doesn't matter anyway since I try to explain
what I know and will learn about it. Of course, it's a complex topic and you could become confused while reading some of my texts if you do not know some basic things but as I already said, I'll try to explain as much as possible to make sure that on one hand I can easily redo everything in the future and on the other hand that people like you can understand what, how and why I did specific things. Probably you're also as enthusiastic as me and want to do something similar or you already gathered experience with that topic and want to help or correct me. If so, just feel free to contribute to this repository, I really appreciate it :D.
